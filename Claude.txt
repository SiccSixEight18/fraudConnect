I'll create a simpler web app with exactly this functionality - four text boxes where you can paste lists of values and visualize their connections.
Multi-Column Fraud Connection VisualizerClick to open code
To use this:

Save as app.py
Install requirements:

bashCopypip install streamlit networkx matplotlib pandas

Run:

bashCopystreamlit run app.py
Features:

Four customizable text boxes with editable column names
Automatic connection detection between values in the same row
Color-coded nodes by column type
Connection analysis showing shared values
Sample data button
PNG visualization (save by right-clicking the graph)

The visualization shows:

Each unique value as a node
Different colors for different column types
Lines connecting values that appear in the same row
Clear labels for all values

Would you like me to adjust anything about:

The visualization style
Node colors
Layout algorithm
